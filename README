Completing this project will require writing the following C files:

schedule_fcfs.c
schedule_sjf.c
schedule_rr.c
schedule_priority.c
schedule_priority_rr.c

The fcfs, sjf, rr and priority algorithms is easy, but I had some problem with the priority round robin algorithms. The output always be wrong, and it
spent some time for me to solve the issue such as the issue that there are some task with lower priority always execute first.
